## I am...

A developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A photographer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;A traveller.&nbsp;&nbsp;An imaginer.

I love making friends and reinventing wheels.

## Me off the net...

Some of my small wishes: make a foreign friend, go to the Mediterranean, open a homestay, and write an e-book of my own. The purpose of writing a book isn't to publish, but to record my own stories and experiences. In addition, I hope that my website is a business card, and people who come here will gain something. 

About programming, about the front end, I will always love. May the story not end and youth will not end.
