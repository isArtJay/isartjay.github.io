## I am...

> A developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A photographer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;A traveller.

I'm Yujie Bian, a 22-year-old computer science junior, back-end developer and open source enthusiast.

I'm a programmer, I was a liberal arts student in high school, and I chose computer science in college because I was "impacted" by the afterglow of the Internet, and I wanted to be a superhero who changed the world with the power of technology.

I majored in Go/C++, and apart from my studies, I spend most of my time on V2EX, GitHub, Twitter, Telegram and other platforms.

I created [Mouse.css](https://github.com/isArtJay/Mouse)(a CSS3 Hover library) and [AtomicOS](https://github.com/isArtJay/AtomicOS)(A lightweight operating system), and now run them with my best mate. 

## About this website

The construction of my personal website also went through several twists and turns, first changing the domain name several times, mainly because each time I felt that there was a better and more appropriate, changing and changing, and now the domain name is `lien.run`.

What does it mean? lien is French, which translates to "link" in English, and the domain suffix run was chosen to mean: modern Internet life is full of links to all kinds of websites.

The site is built using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages and Coding Pages. I was having some trouble with the SSL certificate auto-renewal, but now that I've unhosted GitHub Pages, the problem has been solved.

After hours of tweaking details and coding, pressing Ctrl-Shift-P a few times, looking up technical documentation, and searching for information, the site was finally built.

Since Jekyll is a static website generator, the technology stack of the website is simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No PHP, no Go, no Python.

I've also "decorated" my homepage in a fancy way, enriching the site like crazy: installing plugins, playing music, etc. But what's the point? But what is the use of this, the most important thing should be the content, not these visual feast.

I think our generation of technology people, everyone should have their own personal blog, whether it is built by themselves or third-party platform. It represents a microcosm of our society's technological development, and also reflects the process of change in our own technology stack.

Not surprisingly, my site will continue to run forever.

## About the programming

The earliest contact with programming should be the first year of high school, is 2014, I remember at that time I often talk with a friend about the Internet, I said to him, "we also want to develop software, write code, change the world with technology."

In the second semester of high school, I didn't see my friend again for a long time after the school year started, so I thought he was at home, and when I contacted him, he said he quit school and went to learn programming, like C#.

We kept in touch for a long time after that. We walked around the playground of his school, talking about the Internet and the future as usual, as if we had agreed to meet at some junction in the future.

In September 2017, I also finally stepped into the university and my programming career started.

I think the introductory programming language for most universities is C or C#, and our school is no exception, offering C# as a class in the first semester of freshman year. I was very happy when I debugged one control window after another on my computer, it was the first time I ran a program and I finally knew what writing code was all about.

Our major was mainly in front-end development, and later, we started to learn JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and we were dealing with web pages all day long, learning how to layout them, how to control their style, and how to make them "live" and "move". We are learning how to make web pages "live" and "move".

While learning the front-end, the back-end is also a compulsory course for us.

Slowly, "is PHP the best language in the world or not" became a topic we often discussed. After learning PHP and MySQL, I finally understood that data on web pages is not just written in code.

Now, I've moved from front-end to back-end development, and I've changed my programming language to a back-end language like Go/C++. I also understand that programming languages are ultimately just development tools, no one is the best or the worst, just different application scenarios.

I really like those articles by Wang Yin: "Talking about the Importance of Programs" mentions that the most important criterion to see if a program is well written is whether it can solve problems effectively; "The Wisdom of Programming" argues that it is important to write elegant, modular, readable, simple, intuitive, and flawless code; "How to Master All Programming Languages" emphasizes the importance of mastering the language features of a programming language for Thinking About Languages suggests that everyone should learn several programming languages so that they are not so constrained by a single language that they cannot accept new, more advanced ideas.

Programming itself is a creative work, an art, and to be proficient in any art, we need a lot of practice.

## About the writing

The purpose of my writing is actually quite simple.

There are many things you think you understand, but you don't, and when it comes to writing them down, you still feel clueless and your mind goes blank. So, writing can constantly improve your ability to make things clear.

Writing isn't just writing either, it doesn't work if it's all output and no input. If I suddenly forget a point in the process of writing, I will look for it on the Internet, and when I find it, I will revisit it and probably read other things about it.

I have always been a very willing to share people, I write things, certainly want people to read. Of course, it's not impossible to write when no one reads it, and it's more or less motivating when someone reads it. The more people see my work, the higher the reward, and the happier I am, which is a chain reaction.

Through writing, I find myself growing in this way. This growth is a kind of wealth, I get gain and keep correcting my mistakes; others also get guidance or help and will take a lot less detours.

This will also be a good resume, a very valuable ID, the higher the value of my work, I will meet a lot of cattle, and deal with cattle will let my eyes get a great opening, so I will become more cattle, this is a virtuous cycle.

Very often, we are all alone, it is difficult to find a confidant, and even more difficult to find yourself.

Writing is something that I will continue to do.

## Anything not related to the web?

Sure. I love photography, I often take a lot of beautiful photos when I travel and then print them out. I think that photos can remember the beauty of people. When I am old, I can find some fond memories of my youth through photos.

I don't feel much about games. Many of my classmates were surprised that I don't play games, "You don't even play games?" I don't know why, I just couldn't get interested.

I also feel that spending a few hours a day immersed in the world of games is really a waste of good time.

In addition, travel will be part of my future life, going to poetic places, writing words, drinking a cup of coffee, is very happy.

I have a few small wishes: make a foreign friend, go to the Mediterranean, open a B&B/cafe, write my own e-book.

Outside of the internet, we still can't live without the internet, social networks, and...

## Elsewhere on the interwebs

As programmers, browsing technical articles is essential, and we must always keep up with current technology trends so that we don't become "disconnected" from the world.

That's why the technical community is so important, and it's a great way for me to get information.

I also have a collection of blogs of many people, including the current technical leaders of major Internet companies, programming gurus, and also young and particularly talented students from prestigious universities. Their blogs in their own self-summary, technical sharing, etc. have a very far-reaching impact on me.

Our footprints all over the Internet, others have walked the road, we may also walk in the future.
