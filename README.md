## I am...

> A developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A photographer.&nbsp;&nbsp;A creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;A traveller.&nbsp;&nbsp;An imaginer.
>

In 2018, I started to build my website, since then, I discovered the existence of a website hosting system and hosted the site on `Github Pages` and `Coding Pages`. But I never have spare time to manage my website, in August 2020, I decided to restart this journey. This website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.

In 2020, many unforgettable things happened, just in August of same year, I created [Mouse.css](https://github.com/isArtJay/Mouse), a CSS3 Hover library, and now run it with my best mate. The idea for Mouse.css was born on May 2020, so far, we had a logo, a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/mouse-css/mouse?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) and [Telegram group](https://t.me/mouse_chat).

I hope that my website is a business card, and people who come here will gain something. I will always love programming and front-end development.

## Anything not related to the web?

Sure. I love photography, I often take a lot of beautiful photos when I travel and then print them out. I think that photos can remember the beauty of people. When I am old, I can find some fond memories of my youth through photos.

Some of my small wishes: make a foreign friend, go to the Mediterranean, open a homestay, and write an e-book of my own. The purpose of writing a book isn't to publish, but to record my own stories and experiences.

## So how was this site built?

With blood, sweat and tears! Nah, I’m just kidding.

This is a Jekyll site, hosted on `GitHub Pages` and `Coding Pages`. It was built migrated after months of procrastination and hours upon hours of pressing Ctrl-Shift-P, resizing windows ploughing through documentation, googling and of course, actual coding. This site is a constant work-in-progress as I add tweaks, features and content.

Since Jekyll is a static site generator, everything here is HTML, CSS and JS.

No PHP, no Go, no Python, nilch.
